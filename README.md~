# Amazon Order Confirmation Script
## Intent
This is a script designed to retrieve information from external sources in order to confirm Amazon orders. The script retrieves order information from various sources, and turns it into a form that Amazon can understantd. 
The are a few parts to this:

* **Retrieve data**- right now, our sources come from our Hafele.com/us account, and hardwareresources.com accounts. These modules are included separately for anyone interested. 

* **Send** data. This part is designed to work with the Amazon Merchant Services, and will send order confirmations once data is retrieved. 
## Collaboration
If you are interested in working on this script, let us know. We can turn your interest into something beneficial for the project. 

Thanks for reading.
